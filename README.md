# <u>Undergraduate CICS Course Planner</u>

Welcome to my Undergraduate CICS Course Planner! This has been a project I've wanted to do for a few months now, and I finally have been able to work on it.

This website's purpose is to provide a central location that Umass Amherst Undergraduates in the College of Information and Computer Science can search for any CICS class, with a built in search filter, and generate potential schedules for the rest of their time as an undergraduate student based on criteria of their choosing.

Currently, the website only supports schedule building for B.S. Computer Science majors, but I plan to add B.S. in Informatics and B.A. in Computer Science as well!

## <u>Planned Features</u>
- Add B.S. in Informatics and B.A. in Computer Science support
- Add support to create a schedule based on concentrations the user is interested in, i.e Software Engineering, Cybersecurity, etc.
- Add support for user authentication and login. Students will sign in with their UMass Google Accounts. Users will have information saved in their accounts, such as saved schedules.

Currently, my tech stack includes:\n 
Angular, Material, HTML, and CSS for the front-end.\n 
Flask, Python, and OpenAI for the backend.\n
MongoDB for the database.\n

Thank you for reading!
